# WikipediaViewer

It is the same as the FreeCodeCampus [Wikipedia Viwer project][1] for learning.

Some improvements:
1. Since 'bourbon' scss libarary have many deprecated features, modify the css
2. $http service for v1.6 have changed much from v1.2, so the ajax is better
to be realized with jQuery.
3. The original webpack.config.js in [this project][2] is hard to understand straightly,
so refactor the webpack config to be more friendly.

To be done:
1. Unit test
2. E2E test
